## Overall look up on the task
The system has a list of faculties for which it is necessary to implement the possibility of sorting:
- by name (a-z, z-a);
- by the number of budget places;
- by the total number of seats.

The entrant is registered in the system. During registration it is necessary to enter full name, email, city,
region, name of educational institution (optional: attach a scan of the certificate with grades).
The entrant can register for one or more faculties. When registering at

The system administrator has the rights to:
- adding, deleting or editing faculty;
- blocking or unlocking the entrant;
- adding the results of entrants to the Statement;

the result of enrollment in a particular form of education, as well as non-enrollment with assistance
sending an email to the entrant).
